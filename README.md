# Chrome PDF Screenshot

This is a tool to take PDF screenshots of HTML pages. Since the page size is fully customizable and there is no header or footer, this works better than Chrome or Firefox's built-in print to PDF functionality for posters and similar content. Follow the instructions on [Getting Started - Chrome Developers](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/getstarted/#unpacked) to load the extension.
